### Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting powered by [Rouge].

~~~ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
~~~

### LaTeX Math Blocks
Write formulas in familiar LaTeX syntax. Powered by [KaTeX].

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \phi(x,y) &= \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right) \\[2em]
            &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j)            \\[2em]
            &= (x_1, \ldots, x_n)
               \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
                 \phi(e_1, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
                 \vdots          & \ddots & \vdots         \\
                 \phi(e_n, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
               \end{array}\right)
               \left(\begin{array}{c}
                 y_1    \\
                 \vdots \\
                 y_n
               \end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
